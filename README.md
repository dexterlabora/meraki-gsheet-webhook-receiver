# Google Sheets Webhook Receiver for Meraki Alerts

## Overview

This Google Sheets script is designed to act as a webhook receiver for Meraki alerts and callbacks. When set up, it captures data sent by Meraki systems and formats this information within a Google Sheet. This setup is ideal for network administrators and IT professionals who use Meraki products and want an easy way to log and analyze alerts and callback data.

## Features

- **Webhook Receiver**: Captures Meraki alerts and callback data sent to the Google Sheets app.
- **Data Formatting**: Flattens JSON objects from Meraki for easier spreadsheet use.
- **Dynamic Header Creation**: Automatically creates and updates sheet headers based on incoming data keys.
- **Time Formatting**: Converts specific timestamp keys to UTC format.
- **Error Handling**: Adds extra columns to the sheet if the data contains more keys than the existing columns to prevent out of bounds errors.
- **Test Functions**: Includes test functions for alert and callback data to ensure proper setup and functionality.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Google Sheets Script Setup**:
   - Open a new Google Sheet.
   - Go to Extensions > Apps Script.
   - Copy the provided code into the Code.gs file.
   - Save the script.

2. **Publishing the App**:
   - In the Apps Script editor, click on 'Deploy' > 'New Deployment'.
   - Choose 'Execute as You' and set 'Who has access' to 'Anyone (including anonymous)'.
   - Click 'Deploy' and authorize the app when prompted.

3. **Obtaining Webhook URL**:
   - After deployment, a URL will be generated. This will act as your Webhook URL.
   - Copy this URL.

4. **Meraki Dashboard Configuration**:
   - Log into your Meraki Dashboard.
   - Navigate to the 'Alerts & Administration' section.
   - In the 'Webhooks' section, add a new webhook with the URL obtained from the Apps Script.

5. **Testing**:
   - Use the `testAlert()` and `testCallback()` functions in the script to simulate alert and callback data.

## Usage

- When Meraki sends an alert or callback to the provided Webhook URL, the script will automatically process and display this data in the Google Sheet.
- The script will create a new sheet for each alert type and format the data with appropriate headers.

## Best Practices

- Regularly monitor and maintain the Google Sheet for optimal performance.
- Ensure that your Meraki dashboard is correctly configured to send data to the Google Sheets webhook.
- Review the data periodically to ensure it's being captured and formatted correctly.

## Troubleshooting

- If data is not appearing in the sheet, check the webhook configuration in your Meraki dashboard.
- Ensure that the script is properly deployed and accessible.
- Verify that the Meraki system is correctly sending alerts and callbacks.
